# IAS-106
Intermediate Microeconomic Theory
This is a Demo notebook for motivating the use of Python notebooks in teaching economics. The idea is to motivate simple supply and demand as seen in Econ 1 or Econ 100 - and then to use this simple model for Equilibrium, Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, and welfare implications of a tax.  

The code is adapted from Finance and Economics website. The preliminary widgets were added by Ron Walker.  This was taught in IAS 106 in Summer 2018.
